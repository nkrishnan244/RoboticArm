# Introduction/Goal

The goal of this project is to take existing knowledge about robotic arms (FK, IK, etc) that have been used mainly in Python and Matlab (outside of using MoveIt! ROS C++ interface), and use it to learn OpenGL, and to get more experience using the C++ Matrix Library Eigen. 

# Robotic Arm Choice 

I decided to use the UR5 by Universal Robotics as it is one of the most commonly used robotic arms. It could be cool to have the user input their own robotic arm properties at some point.
